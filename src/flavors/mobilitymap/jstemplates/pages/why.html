<h1>Why does {{ config.app.name }} exist?</h1>

<p>Mobility map allows anyone to <strong>hint</strong> at something on a map. A hint can be a question or a comment. Other people can respond to hints and provide feedback. Public transit authority developers can get <strong>authority status</strong> via moderation in order to provide an official response to hints.</p>

<p>Hints can pile up. When someone goes to place a hint, they select from categories that allow them to narrow their hints to easily searchable things. If similar hints show up in that area, the user may be prompted to <strong>stack</strong> their hint.</p>

<p><strong>Stacking</strong> doesn't remove a hint, it only makes it more visible. Stacked hints help clue authorities in on significant information, and it also helps citizens communicate with one another.</p>
