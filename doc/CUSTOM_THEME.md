It's simple to customize the Shareabouts Web front-end application to coordinate with your organization's brand guidelines. The [custom.css](../src/flavors/default/static/css/custom.css) file contains CSS rules that can be edited to override Shareabouts' default styles. Simply uncomment and edit the example declarations. While more advanced layout techniques are possible within this file, only the basic selectors required to change colors, fonts, shadows, and such are included.
